{"body":"### Welcome to the Resource Oriented Template Language project.\r\nThe Resource Oriented Template Language (_rstl_ pronounced <em> \\'rest-É™l\\ </em>) allows web developers to build web sites using a simple template language syntax inspired by Django templates. The template language features template and site inheritance and allows the layout and structure of pages in the web application to be cleanly separated from the resources that make up a page. The template engine has bindings for Java, which allows developers to render these templates in any Java based application or application server.\r\n\r\n```django\r\n{% extends \"basictemplate.html\"%}\r\n{% layout \"layouts/213layout.html\"%}\r\n\r\n{% block leftnav %}\r\n   {% resource.xhtml \"/resources/categories\" %}\r\n{% endblock %}\r\n\r\n{% block mainbody %}\r\n   {% resource.xhtml \"/resources/home/adbanner\" %}\r\n   {% resource.xhtml \"/resources/products/featured\" %}\r\n{% endblock %}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe Resource Oriented Template Language was created by Madhu Chetuparambil (@madchuck) in 2010 and was released as an open source project with the modified BSD license in 2012.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with _rstl_?
